# Twatter
This tool is designed for nerds that want a good (or best possible) Twitter handle, it shouldn't be that important but it just is, I built it after [struggling to find a handle](https://medium.com/@ElliottInvent/becoming-a-new-twitter-user-is-not-easy-3e08eb18d7fe). People that use Twatter are called twats, as the creator I am of course a massive twat.

A note for my American cousins: twat (rhymes with bat) doesn't mean the same in UK as it does in America, it's different. It's a bit like 'goofy jerk' but English. Anyway, back to Twatter.

Here's a preview of it in action:

## Other use cases
Twatter can be used for researchers looking for trends and for brand protection. I realise it also has uses for people building bots and those spreading 'fake news' â€“ people looking to use it for that should [click here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQfrLViDnWo).

## You need your own Twitter Developer Account
You need your own Twitter Developer account and credentials to use Twatter. Anyone with a Twitter account can sign up for a Developer account at https://dev.twitter.com/apps. 

If you don't already have an account with Twitter, just use the username you are automatically assigned during the sign-up process. You can change it easily later. Once you've got a developer account, you'll be issued with a:
- consumer_key
- consumer_secret
- access_token
- access_token_secret

Enter this information in to `settings.EXAMPLE.yaml` file, rename the file to `settings.yaml` and you're good to go. 

## Running Twatter
Download the repository, navigate to the downloaded folder, add your Twitter credentials to settings.yml (see above) and then you're ready to run it. 

if you're using Bundler, run:
```ruby
bundle install
```
or, if you're not, you can install the required gems manually:
```ruby
gem install twitter logger

```

Then just run the script and follow the instructions in terminal:
```
ruby twatter.rb
````

## Loading Lists into Twatter
Two lists have been provided, a simple example file listing colours (list/colours.txt) and a list of the most common words in the english language courtesy of [deekayen](https://gist.github.com/deekayen/4148741). New lists can be created simply by entering words or characters on new lines and saving the file in the 'lists' directory.

Loading the files into Twatter is simple, just enter them in your pattern surrounded by square brackets:
```
[colours]clouds
```

This will generate combinations for 'blueclouds', 'blackclouds', 'greenclouds' etc. Lists can be created on the fly by comma separating values, e.g:

```
[great,good,ok,poor,bad]example
```
